Step 1: Plan the Project

To-Do List App Features:
- Add a new task using an input field and "Add" button.
- Display all tasks in a list with their completion status.
- Edit a taskâ€™s text by clicking an "Edit" button and saving changes.
- Delete a task by clicking a "Delete" button.
- Mark a task as completed or not using a checkbox.

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React.js, Axios, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- Tools: Git/GitHub, Postman, Vercel, Render

Wireframe:
- Created as a hand-drawn sketch and considered for Step 1 planning.
- Layout Description:
  - Header: A rectangle labeled "To-Do List" at the top.
  - Input Form: A horizontal rectangle (input field) next to a smaller rectangle labeled "Add" below the header.
  - Task List: Three rows of tasks, each consisting of:
    - A square (checkbox), with an "x" in the second task (Task2) indicating completion.
    - Task text labeled "Task1", "Task2", and "Task3" respectively.
    - Two smaller rectangles labeled "Edit" and "Delete" for each task.
  - Overall: Enclosed in a larger border, with elements spaced out and aligned vertically.

- Notes:
  - The wireframe captures the key features (Add, Edit, Delete, Mark as Done).
  - Approximate sizes and positions are used (e.g., header at top, input below, tasks in rows).
  - Deviations from the plan: Tasks are not grouped into single 350x40px rectangles; elements (checkbox, text, buttons) are separate boxes. Exact dimensions (350x50px header, 250x30px + 80x30px input, 350x40px tasks at 160px, 210px, 260px) and precise positioning can be refined later in Excalidraw if needed.
